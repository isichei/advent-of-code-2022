Go time... but then switched back to Rust as I missed it too much :heart_eyes:

## Go 

All go stuff in `go/`

cd into each exercise folder and `go run main.go`

Running: `go version go1.19.3 darwin/amd64` 

## Rust

All Rust stuff in `rust/`

cd into each exercise folder and `cargo run` (or `cargo test` if tests are present)

Running `rustc 1.66.0 (69f9c33d7 2022-12-12)`
